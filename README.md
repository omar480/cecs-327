## CECS 327 Lab 3

- Create a program that uses UDP and lets a client communicate with a server.

## Building

- Compile both the `Client.java` and `Server.java` files using `javac <classname>.java`

## Running

- Execute the server first, `java Server` then the client, `java Client`

## Arguments

- You can either pass the port and IP address as arguments or enter it in the client's runtime.

- To pass as arguments, try `java Client 6789 localhost` or `java Client 6789 127.0.0.1`

- The server is using port 6789 by default.
